Middleware.removeTrailingSlash()
Middleware.bodyLimit()

e.Group() to create a middleware on a set of routes where as e.Use() creates middleware for all routes

Postgrest


Routing 
* Echo.Any() to have same handler for all the routes
* Echo.Group() to group routes based on pattern, We can have optional middleware for these routes
* Echo.Match() to use the same handler for some methods
* What if multiple routes match the URL order is static,Param,MatchAny
* We can assign names to routes, This can be used to distinguish routes even if they have same handlers
* Echo.URI() and Echo.Reverse() builds the route url for us
* Echo.Routes returns all the routes defined in Echo object

Static Files
* Echo.Static() is used to hide the actual location on the server by proxying it
* Echo.File() also sets up a route but we can directly put a file here instead of writing handler

Templates
* What are templates for??

Testing

Middleware
* Echo.Use is used to register middle ware for all the paths/routes that are registered after the Echo.Use call
* Echo.Pre is used for all routes irrespective of where it is declared Question : But from code side seems like there is no diff between Pre and Use'
* Echo.Group with optional middleware
* Echo.<Method>() with optional middleware 
* Example on conditional logger middleware.LoggerWithConfig()

Middleware#BasicAuth
* middleware.BasicAuth
* middleware.BasicAuthWithConfig
* middleware.BodyDump
* middleware.BodyDumpWithConfig //These two are used to dump request/response payloads, Generally not preferable when the payloads are heavy
* middleware.BodyLimit() 
* middleware.BodyLImitWithConfig() // These two are used to make sure that "request" Payload is below certain limit
* CasbinAuthMiddleware for authentication under different modes
* CORS middleware middleware.CORS(), middleware.CORSWithConfig()
* CSRF middleware to CSRF attacks, middleware.CSRF(), middleware.CSRFWithConfig()
* middleware.Decompress(), middleware.DecompressWithConfig() if content-encoding header is set to gzip
* middleware.Gzip(),middleware.GzipWithConfig() compresses the "Response"
* Jaeger tracing middleware
* middleware.JWT() for Json web token authentication
* middleware.KeyAuth() for key based authentication
* middleware.Logger() to log the information for request types
* middleware.MethodOverride(),middleware.MethodOverrideWithConfig() can override POST methods to other types
* prometheus.NewPrometheus() to collect metrics for the server over time
* middleware.Proxy() can be used to load balance over multiple urls using middleware.NewRoundRobinBalancer(), middleware.NewRandomBalancer()
* middleware.ProxyWithConfig() can balance and rewrite the path of request if necessary
* middleware.RateLimiter() and middleware.RateLimiterWithConfig() used to limit number of requests to a server over given time'
* middleware.Recover() recovers from panics anywhere in the stack
* middleware.HTTPSRedirect() redirects all http requests to https requests
* middleware.HTTPSWWWRedirect(), middleware.HTTPSNONWWWRedirect(), middleware.WWWRedirect(),middleware.NONWWWRedirect()
* middleware.RequestID() creates a unique ID for a request //But from code side why is it setting id to the Response instead of request
* middleware.Rewrite() and middleware.RewriteWithConfig() to adjust the paths in the urls, this can also be used to adjust the regex's aswell
* middleware.secure() provides security against various attacks such as XSS etc
* session middleware facilitates in session management by storing/accessing cookies
* middleware.Static() is similar to e.Static() used to access the contents in file system of the server but we can hide the absolute location on server for security reasons
* middleware.Timeout() and middleware.TimeoutwithConfig() are used to timeout the application after certain time period
* middleware.RemoveTrailingSlash() , middleware.AddTrailingSlash() , middleware.AddTrailingSlashWithConfig


Cookbook ?



Things to look at
* TLS what is certificate and key here
* CORS and its uses
* embedded files embed mode and live mode
* c.FormFile() to get the file name from client??
